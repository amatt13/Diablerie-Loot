# Diablerie-Loot
C# implementaion of the loot system from the DnD Diablo II adventure from 2000.

A similar implementation can be found here: https://github.com/LVoisard/d2_dnd_magic_item_generator

This project was initially made back in 2021 when I wanted to run a campaign in the adventure for a friend group. The campaign never went anywhere, but at least I had some fun creating this tool.

NB: I have not included mana potions or inscribed scrolls, as I did not want to use them in my campaign.
NB: There might be some spelling mistakes due to me ripping the text from a PDF of the adventure. I have tried to correct mistakes when I saw them, but there are probably plenty more to be fixed.

Feel free to create issues and pull requests if you spot any msitakes, but please also note that I don't plan to add any features - for now.
